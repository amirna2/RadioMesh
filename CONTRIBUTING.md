## Technical Requirements & Background

While we welcome contributors from all backgrounds, contributing code to RadioMesh requires familiarity with:

- Modern C++ development
- VSCode and PlatformIO environment
- Arduino framework concepts
- ESP32 and embedded systems development

We try to provide some guidance and documentation to help you get started, but we expect contributors to have a basic understanding of these technologies as we cannot provide individual tutoring.

Having experience with wireless networks and radio protocols is beneficial but not required. What's most important is solid software development practices and willingness to learn.

## Development Tools & AI Usage

This project acknowledges the use of AI coding assistants in development, such as Claude, Github Copilot. However:

- All contributions, whether AI-assisted or not, must meet our quality standards
- AI tools should complement, not replace, good software development practices
- All code undergoes thorough review by project maintainers
- Contributors are responsible for understanding and testing their code

The final acceptance of any contribution is based on its technical merit, code quality, and alignment with project goals, regardless of how it was developed.

## Getting Started
