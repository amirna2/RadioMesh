# Contributing to RadioMesh
First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to contribute! We greatly appreciate all feedback, ideas, and contributions. To keep this project organized and foster an inclusive and productive environment, we kindly ask that you follow these guidelines.

## Issues
Before submitting a new issue, please take a moment to review the issue tracker, Q&A, and FAQ to ensure your concern hasn't already been addressed. This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the focus on new and unresolved topics.

When submitting new issues, please adhere to the following to ensure your concerns are addressed promptly and effectively:

**Questions are welcome, Spam is not:**
We encourage questions and discussions. However, issues lacking a descriptive body will be considered spam and will be closed and locked immediately.

**Use Issue Templates:**
This repository provides issue templates for reporting bugs and suggesting features. Please use them accordingly. If none of the templates fit your issue, only then use the default issue option.

**Clarity is Key:** Be as clear and specific as possible when creating your issue. Titles like "not working" or "build error" are too vague and will be closed until more specific details are provided. Similarly, issues with scant information or significant formatting issues will be closed until improved.

**Stale Issues:** If an issue remains inactive for 2 weeks after the original author has been asked for further details and does not respond, it will be closed due to inactivity. We do this to keep focus on active issues. You are welcome to reopen the issue once you have more information to share.

## Technical Requirements & Background

While we welcome contributors from all backgrounds, contributing code to RadioMesh requires familiarity with:

- Modern C++ development
- VSCode and PlatformIO environment
- Arduino framework concepts
- ESP32 and embedded systems development

We try to provide some guidance and documentation to help you get started, but we expect contributors to have a basic understanding of these technologies as we cannot provide individual tutoring.

Having experience with wireless networks and radio protocols is beneficial but not required. What's most important is solid software development practices and willingness to learn.

## Development Tools & AI Usage

This project acknowledges the use of AI coding assistants in development, such as Claude, Github Copilot. However:

- All contributions, whether AI-assisted or not, must meet our quality standards
- AI tools should complement, not replace, good software development practices
- All code undergoes thorough review by project maintainers
- Contributors are responsible for understanding and testing their code

The final acceptance of any contribution is based on its technical merit, code quality, and alignment with project goals, regardless of how it was developed.

## Getting Started
