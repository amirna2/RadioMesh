# Code of Conduct

Be friendly and patient, welcoming, considerate, respectful, careful in the words you choose.
When we disagree, try to understand why.

In other words: _Don't be an a*hole!_

*Inspired by the [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), but way shorter because life's too short for long documents nobody reads!*
